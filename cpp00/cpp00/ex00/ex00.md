# Exercise 00: Megaphone

## Exercise Details
- **Exercise:** 00
- **Title:** Megaphone
- **Turn-in Directory:** `ex00/`
- **Files to Turn In:** `Makefile`, `megaphone.cpp`
- **Forbidden Functions:** None

## Objective
Write a program that behaves as described below. The goal is to transform any input string into uppercase, simulating a megaphone effect.

## Program Behavior

- The program should take one or more arguments and convert all letters to uppercase.
- If no arguments are provided, it should output a loud, unbearable noise.
- All input strings should be printed on the same line after conversion, with spaces between them.

### Examples

1. When input contains a sentence:
    ```bash
    $> ./megaphone "shhhhh... I think the students are asleep..."
    SHHHHH... I THINK THE STUDENTS ARE ASLEEP...
    ```

2. When multiple inputs are provided:
    ```bash
    $> ./megaphone Damnit " ! " "Sorry students, I thought this thing was off."
    DAMNIT ! SORRY STUDENTS, I THOUGHT THIS THING WAS OFF.
    ```

3. When no input is provided:
    ```bash
    $> ./megaphone
    * LOUD AND UNBEARABLE FEEDBACK NOISE *
    ```

## Guidelines
- Solve the exercise in a **C++ manner**.
